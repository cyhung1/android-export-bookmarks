android-export-bookmarks
========================

Without a physical keyboard/mouse, a large bookmark list can become unworkable on the android device.

Export all browser bookmarks to a file and sort/edit/import to desktop.

After exporting bookmarks, use `adb pull /sdcard/bookmarks.txt` to get a local copy.
